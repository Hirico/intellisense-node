# intellisense-node

This is the README for a vscode extension "intellisense-node".

## Features

Did you ever have the moment when you wanted to accomplish a task in your hand while didn't know which method or even library to use? (npm-intellisense may not work because you probably haven't npm-installed target dependency yet) Describe your task and let this extension find the right API for you.

Currently it only supports a select set of nodejs APIs.

## How this works
